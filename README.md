The objective of this NLP project was to build a classifier that can predict whether a piece of news is fake or real based on its content. 

For EDA & Text Preprocessing for NLP were used: data cleaning, feature engineering, WordCloud visualizer, handling outliers by using CountVectorizer, regEx, nltk, and spaCy for tokenization, named entity recognition, and lemmatization. 

For prediction were used different Bag Of Words models with sklearn (Logistic regression, Random forest),
as well as Deep Learning NLP models with tensorFlow.keras: RNN architecture with different Embeddings.

The data used for this project was drawn from Kaggle datasets:  https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
Because all CSV-files that were created during different stages of the project, as well as 'glove.6B.200d.txt' file that used in DL-Model2 are too large for GitHub, they are not uploaded to the project's folder.
This project was developed with Cecilia Moskovitch.

The definition of Fake News:
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. Once common in print, the prevalence of fake news has increased with the rise of social media. Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it.
